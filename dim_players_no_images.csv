Matt Henry,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,"A slippery fast bowler, Matt Henry almost didn't play for New Zealand, as he underwent a major back surgery in 2012. Two years later, though, he was called up as cover during the ODI series against India, and thanks to a niggle to fellow injury-prone Hamish Bennett, Henry put the black cap on and registered the third-best figures for a New Zealand debutant in ODIs, claiming four wickets to seal New Zealand's 4-0 series triumph."

Mustafizur Rahman,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Bowler,Left arm Fast medium,"Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka to try out for a fast-bowling camp in 2012, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in Satkhira, some 300km from Dhaka. He got admitted to the BCB's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. "
Babar Azam(c),Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"A right-hand, top-order batsman known for his discipline and level-headed attitude, Babar Azam laid claim to a long-term spot in Pakistan's batting line-up with a strong performance in 2016, making three consecutive ODI hundreds against West Indies in the UAE, and a 90 in his third Test, in Hamilton. He was 22 years old at the time."

Roston Chase,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"A tall offspin-bowling allrounder from Barbados, Roston Chase won a place in West Indies' Test team after strong showings with bat and ball in the 2015-16 Professional Cricket League. He scored 710 runs in ten matches at an average of 59.16, bowled more than he ever had in the past, and took 23 wickets at an average of 17.26 (including twin five-fors in a match against Guyana)."

Saad Bin Zafar(c),Canada,Left hand Bat,Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"The Pakistan-born Saad Bin Zafar earned the honour of being Canada's first captain at the T20 World Cup in 2024. That was a culmination of a long career with Canada that started with a first-class debut in 2008 before representing the team consistently in all formats.As a slow left-arm spinner and left-hand batter, Saad has also been part of the Caribbean Premier League, representing St Lucia Zouks. In November 2021, he entered the record books as the first man to concede no run in a four-over spell in a T20I when he finished with figures of 4-4-0-2 against Panama.Sreshth Shah"
Marco Jansen,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Bowling Allrounder,Left arm Medium fast,"At 2.06 metres tall, Marco Jansen's height immediately marks him out as a fast bowler but he began his cricket career as a batter. Jansen's first coach was his father, Koos, who trained both him and his twin brother Duan in their home town of Potchefstroom. At the age of 17, the pair were picked to bowl to the touring Indian side in the nets and impressed the likes of Virat Kohli with his pace and accuracy. "
Rishabh Pant,India,Left hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,,
George Dockrell,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"Left-arm spinner George Dockrell made his international debut for Ireland as a 17-year-old in 2010 though he had been bowling spin for only four years at that point, after coach Brian O'Rourke spotted him having a bowl in a car park during an Ireland age-group tour of Wales.

Mohammed Siraj,India,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast,"Mohammed Siraj's rise as a seamer was remarkably swift. The son of an autorickshaw driver in Hyderabad, he only began playing the game in class seven. It was in 2015 that he first bowled with a cricket ball. In 2017, he bagged an IPL contract worth INR 2.6 crore. Months later, he was wearing an India shirt and bowling in a T20 international against New Zealand. "

Aqib Ilyas,Oman,Right hand Bat,Top order Batter,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak Googly",
Craig Young,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,"One of a number of players to emerge out of Ireland's robust Under-19 squads from the early 2010s, Craig Young became the ninth bowler to take a five-for on men's ODI debut when he demolished Scotland in Malahide in September 2014. It was a well-timed performance for Young, considering he had just lost his county contract with Sussex and parlayed that into a Cricket Ireland central contract. "
Dasun Shanaka,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Medium,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Mohammad Nabi,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"Mohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan. An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."

Hardik Pandya,India,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Medium fast,
Charles Amini,Papua New Guinea,Left hand Bat,Allrounder,Legbreak,"CJ Amini comes from a long line of Papua New Guinea cricketing royalty. The third generation of his family to represent the country in cricket, CJ's grandfather Brian and father Charles were both national captains, as was his mother, Kune, for the women's side. His older brother Chris also captained the men's side, while his aunt Cheryl and other brother Colin played for representative PNG sides, leaving little doubt about CJ's future career path."
Vikramjit Singh,Netherlands,Left hand Bat,Opening Batter,Right arm Medium,
Bernard Scholtz,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"Bernard Scholtz's brother Nicolaas is currently playing for the national side, but Bernard has his chance to impress at the forthcoming Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. His aim, he says, is ""to compete against the top teams of the world and get exposure to a higher level of cricket"". And that goal moved a step closer in 2008 when he was named in the squad to face Bermuda in the Intercontinental Cup. He has represented Namibia A and is interested in becoming an engineer. Will Luke August 2008"
Gerhard Erasmus(c),Namibia,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,
Frank Nsubuga,Uganda,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"An offspinning allrounder whose swashbuckling knocks in the lower middle order complement his miserly bowling, Frank Nsubuga made his international debut playing for East and Central Africa in the 1997 ICC Trophy, aged just 16. He soon established his place in the national side, making his first-class debut against Namibia in the Intercontinental Cup in 2004 and earning himself a Man of the Match award as Uganda won by five wickets. Nsubuga steered his team to victory in the World Cricket League final against Argentina three years later, starring with both bat and ball, and has since settled into his role as a senior player for Uganda across all formats.

Suryakumar Yadav,India,Right hand Bat,Batter,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",
Michael Bracewell,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"A member of the Bracewell cricket dynasty, Michael made a late introduction to international cricket, at the age of 31, when he was handed his ODI cap in 2022, against Netherlands, more than ten years after he made his first-class and List A debuts. The innings that vaulted him to the front of the selection queue was a monstrous 141 off 65 balls, which took Wellington from a position of 43 for 5 to chasing down Central Districts' 227 with a ball remaining in a Super Smash T20 match in January that year."
Teja Nidamanuru,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,
Barry McCarthy,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,"Barry McCarthy is an Ireland seam bowler whose involvement with Durham owed much to a recommendation by their England allrounder, Ben Stokes, who faced him in the nets before a one-day international and advised his county to take a look. Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015. A maiden five-wicket haul for Durham against Lancashire in Chester-le-Street the following year added to the good impression he had built at Ireland Under-19 level and during a spell with the Australian grade side Randwick-Petersham.

Hazratullah Zazai,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Opening Batter,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Afghanistan's ascent up the global rankings from ICC Associate nation to Full Member and Test status has been largely propelled by a conveyor belt of fast bowling and mystery spin. But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era.
Safyaan Sharif,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Medium fast,"Born in Huddersfield, Safyaan Sharif made his debut for Scotland at 20 after eye-catching performances for Dunfermline and Scotland U-19s, and took 4 for 27 against the Netherlands in his first ODI in 2011. With 14 wickets at 23.92 apiece, his fast-medium bowling played an important part in Scotland's success in the World Cup Qualifiers in New Zealand in 2014. "
George Munsey,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Opening Batter,Right arm Medium fast,"Known as the reverse-sweeping demon of the Associate world, George Munsey's path to the Scotland national team is as unorthodox as his trademark shot. Born and raised in Oxford, Munsey had dreams of becoming a professional golfer and it was a golf scholarship to the Loretto School, just outside Edinburgh, that brought him to Scotland at age 13. "
Tanzim Hasan Sakib,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,
Keshav Maharaj,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"A left-arm spinner from Northwood Boys High, the alma mater of Shaun Pollock, Keshav Maharaj emerged at a time when South Africa began to take spin seriously. For several seasons in the mid 2010s, spinners were among the leading wicket-takers in South Africa's first-class competition. Maharaj was among them in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and was rewarded with an international call-up the following summer."
Daryl Mitchell,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Medium,"Daryl Mitchell was called into New Zealand's Test team in late 2019 as a replacement for the injured Colin de Grandhomme. He impressed, making an assured 73 against England in his first innings and bowling with good control on a sluggish surface at his home ground, Hamilton. "
Charith Asalanka,Sri Lanka,Left hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,
David Wiese,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Medium fast,"David Wiese joined a marked outflow of South Africa players into county cricket in the 2016-17 season when, at 31, he signed a three-year deal with Sussex, joining his compatriot Stiaan van Zyl. Wiese had not played international cricket since March 2016, and turned down a call-up for a home T20I series against Sri Lanka in making his decision to go Kolpak. "

Virat Kohli,India,Right hand Bat,Top order Batter,Right arm Medium,
Ish Sodhi,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Legbreak,"There is little in Ish Sodhi's statistics to suggest he is an international-quality legspinner, but New Zealand's selectors have seen enough in his aggressive approach and keen attitude to hand him a Test debut after only one full season of first-class cricket. Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhi's journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds."
Naseem Khushi,Oman,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,,
Mitchell Santner,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Bowling Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"A left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner was first elevated to the New Zealand side after a promising 2014-15 domestic season. "
Mahedi Hasan,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"By the time Mahedi Hasan earned his maiden ODI call-up in January 2021, he had already played 159 domestic matches for ten different teams in the first-class, List-A and T20 tournaments. He has now emerged as one of several contenders for the all-rounders' spots in Bangladesh's white-ball teams, having already played in three separate T20I series from 2018 to 2020. "
Will Jacks,England,Right hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"It was a quirk of circumstance that Will Jacks' first standout performance as an England player was a six-wicket haul in a Test match rather than a characteristically dominant white-ball innings. Jacks became the first England debutant spinner since 1993 to claim a five-for on Test debut in 2022, setting up a famous win in Rawalpindi. Not only was it his maiden first-class five-for, he was not even meant to be in the side: he was a late change to the side before the toss with Ben Foakes ruled out through illness."
Ali Khan,U.S.A,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,"Few US players have had a more unusual path to international cricket than Ali Khan. Born and raised in Pakistan, he moved to USA with his parents at the age of 18, settling in Ohio. He was a regular in various private T20 cricket tournaments around the USA, but it wasn't until ICC Americas organised an open trial at Indianapolis in September 2015 that he gained wider attention on the national scene."
Imad Wasim,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"Imad Wasim had been set to study medicine but the offer to play for the Pakistan Under-19 made him change his mind and since then there has been no looking back. Like many aspiring players from his country, he wanted to emulate Wasim Akram but he didn't have the pace his coaches were looking for. Still, the switch to left-arm spin has worked for him. A capable middle-order batsman as well, he was part of the Pakistan side that won the Youth World Cup in 2006, before captaining them in the next edition. "

Andy Balbirnie,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"Already one of Ireland's star batters at No. 3, Andrew Balbirnie flourished with the bat even more after he was made captain across formats late in 2019. Although not a power-hitter, Balbirnie is fluent, keeps the score ticking, and is excellent against spin bowling - his hard sweep is a signature shot."

Matthew Wade,Australia,Left hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Medium,"It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade, who went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batter to T20I World Cup-winning wicketkeeper-finisher, via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over."
Brandon McMullen,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Medium,
Trent Boult,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Left arm Fast medium,"Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions."

Wanindu Hasaranga,Sri Lanka,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Legbreak,"A bruising lower-middle order batsman, and an aggressive legbreak bowler, Wanidu Hasaranga graduated from a strong Richmond College outfit, had a fine run in Sri Lanka's 2015 and 2016 Under-19 teams, and has made a promising start to his domestic cricket career."
Shaheen Shah Afridi,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Bowler,Left arm Fast,"A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother."
Aaron Jones,U.S.A,Right hand Bat,Top order Batter,Legbreak Googly,"Aaron Jones grew up playing alongside Shai Hope and Jason Holder and against Nicholas Pooran and Rovman Powell. He made his List-A debut for Barbados in January 2016 before representing them in first-class cricket the following year. By 2018, though, he had switched to playing for USA. Jones, who was born in Queens in New York, quickly became a mainstay in the USA team. His maiden List-A century against Namibia in the WCL Division 2 in 2019 helped USA earn the side ODI status during that competition."

Devon Conway,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Medium,"Eight years into his professional career, Devon Conway scored his maiden first-class double hundred for Gauteng in a three-day match in South Africa in 2017. Four years later he'd score another double, but this time for New Zealand on his Test debut, becoming only the second - but also the oldest - player to do so in the side, where he quickly established himself as an attacking but composed top-order batter with the ability to shift gears quickly to adapt to match situations.

Tim Southee,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Medium fast,"Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes."

Harry Brook,England,Right hand Bat,Batter,Right arm Medium,"In the winter of 2022-23, Harry Brook announced himself as one of the world's most exciting young players with a staggering run of form across formats, most particularly in England's rebooted Test team. After making his debut against South Africa in September 2022, Brook travelled to Pakistan and New Zealand with Ben Stokes' team, where he peeled off consecutive scores of 153, 87, 9, 111, 89, 54, and 186 to take his overall tally to 809 runs in nine innings, at an extraordinary strike-rate of 98.77. No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement. "
Shadab Khan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Legbreak,"A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."
Mark Chapman,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"Born in Hong Kong, but qualifying for New Zealand through his father, Chapman began his international career with the country of his birth in 2014 having previously made the Under-19 squad as a 15-year-old. He made a century on ODI debut against UAE in 2015 having flown 20 hours following exams in New Zealand, but soon decided to throw his lot in with New Zealand and focused on his career with Auckland. His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on. As a teenager he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing rugby in New Zealand but it did not stall his cricket career.

Paul van Meekeren,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Fast medium,"Paul van Meekeren drew attention to himself during the World Twenty20 qualifiers in 2016 when he produced a spell of 4 for 11 against Ireland. A trial match at Taunton Vale, plus the success of his Dutch compatriot Timm van der Gugten at Glamorgan, was enough for Somerset to offer him a short-term deal midway through the 21016 season which they extended to a two-year deal until the end of the 2018 season. He made his Somerset first-class debut against the Pakistan tourists and followed up with T20 and List-A debuts for the Club in the same season, catching the eye in a NatWest T20 Blast fixture at Cardiff where he bowled with genuine pace. The following season, in his sole Championship appearance, he took four wickets on debut against Essex at Chelmsford.

Logan van Beek,Netherlands,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Medium fast,"Allrounder Logan van Beek came to global attention when he single-handedly ensured West Indies would not make it to the ODI World Cup for the first time in their history. In the Qualifier tournament in Zimbabwe in June 2022, he first lashed 28 off 14 balls to tie the scores in a chase of 374, then smacked three sixes and as many fours off Jason Holder in the Super Over, and sealed the deal with two wickets when West Indies batted."
Mohammad Rizwan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Medium,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. "
Ibrahim Zadran,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Opening Batter,Right arm Medium fast,"Top-order batter Ibrahim Zadran is among Afghanistan's most consistent performers, and young enough to have made his Test debut (in the team's third ever match) before he played a white-ball international. He made 87 in that match in Chattogram, a big, historic win over Bangladesh. "
Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,Left hand Bat,Middle order Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"
James Neesham,New Zealand,Left hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Medium fast,"Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. "

He is a multi-dimensional player, who bats, bowls fastish offspin, fields superbly inside the ring and in the outfield, and keeps part-time as well."
Corey Anderson,U.S.A,Left hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Left arm Medium fast,"Corey Anderson had always been known for his powerful striking, but he took it to a new level on New Year's Day 2014 when he set what was then the world record for the fastest ODI hundred with a 36-ball blitzkrieg against West Indies in Queenstown. It came at a time, a few months after he scored a century in his second Test, that Anderson was suggesting he was ready to fulfill the potential spotted in him as a teenager."

Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing. "

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "

He bowls finger spin with both arms, and does it with skill and accuracy - his offbreaks not quite as good as his left-arm orthodox, but not far off. Understandably, his potential has impressed coaches. In the age of T20, a bowler who can spin it away from both right and left-handers, not to mention employ different lines of attack to the same batsman, could potentially have team owners and data analysts drooling, so long as Kamindu continues to develop those skills.

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."

Travis Head,Australia,Left hand Bat,Top order Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"A talented, aggressive left-hand batter earmarked for big things at a young age, it was Travis Head's second coming as an international cricketer where his career really took off. In late 2021 he was recalled for the Ashes series and made a match-defining 85-ball century at the Gabba - it set the tone for a strong of destructive Test innings while he also reemerged as a white-ball force, so central to Australia's 2023 ODI World Cup plans that they waited for him to recover from a broken hand. In the final against India he made 137 off 120 balls. A cult hero was born."
Jasdeep Singh,U.S.A,Right hand Bat,Bowler,Right arm Medium,"His exuberant celebrations make Jessy Singh hard to miss on the field for USA. Born in New York, Jessy's family moved back to Punjab when he was 3 before he returned to New Jersey at age 13. Jessy was one of the last players cut at trials for the 2011 U-19 World Cup qualifier squad that toured Ireland, but used that as motivation for developing into a medium-pace talent at the senior level. "
Moeen Ali,England,Left hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit. "

Born in Barbados to an English father and Bajan mother, the possibility of his inclusion in England's 2019 World Cup squad became subject of much speculation in the run-up to the tournament. Changes to the ECB's qualification rules led to him becoming eligible after three years of residency - rather than the expected seven - and he was quickly given his chance at international level."
Heinrich Klaasen,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"A wicketkeeper-batter known for his belligerent six-hitting, Heinrich Klaasen first got his chance in the South African team as an injury replacement, opening in place of Quinton de Kock, but went on to establish himself in the middle order in limited-overs cricket. "
Harmeet Singh,U.S.A,Left hand Bat,Bowling Allrounder,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"Delivering with a still head, equipped with a loopy delivery, strapped with a big heart to flight the ball, Harmeet Singh attracted instant praise from coaches and players alike. The former Indian batting stalwart Dilip Sardesai compared Harmeet to his contemporary and spin legend Bishen Bedi the first time he witnessed the Mumbai youngster in action. By 19, Harmeet had featured in two Under-19 World Cups. In his first attempt, in 2010, he proved far too expensive for the team management to retain him in the team regularly. Hungry and resilient to prove his worth two years later, his economy rate of 3.02 was one of the best, despite him missing a couple of matches due to being sick.

Glenn Maxwell,Australia,Right hand Bat,Batting Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"One of the fastest scorers in world cricket, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the limited-overs formats. His ability to make unconventional shots - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - appear routine makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. Maxwell's audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fielder, Maxwell offers an impressive package in one-day and T20 cricket when things click. "

Najmul Hossain Shanto(c),Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Top order Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"Although he made his debut in 2017, and scored two Test hundreds in 2021, it took Najmul Hossain Shanto more than five years to truly establish himself in the Bangladesh side. But once he did, he was rewarded by being appointed Bangladesh's captain in all three formats. "
David Warner,Australia,Left hand Bat,Opening Batter,Legbreak,David Warner's extraordinary batting feats in all three formats for Australia will forever be overshadowed by his role as the chief protagonist of the Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018 and his place as a central figure in Australian cricket's ensuing cultural crisis.

Mahmudullah,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"An allrounder who bowls tidy offspin and bats in the middle order, Mahmudullah has spent the last three years figuring out how fickle form can be. In late 2012, he was the star who derailed West Indies to their first ODI series defeat in Bangladesh, and was a step away from captaincy. A poor season later, his place was continually questioned and he was even dropped for the 2014 Asia Cup. After another five months, Mahmudullah finally found form and became an automatic choice."

Michael Leask,Scotland,Right hand Bat,Allrounder,Right arm Offbreak,"Michael Leask is an explosive batsman from Aberdeen. He showed as much when he smeared five sixes during a memorable 16-ball 42 in an ODI against England in May 2014. But he has been hampered by inconsistency, and he only mustered 56 runs at an average of 9.33 during the World Cup Qualifiers in 2014. Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.
